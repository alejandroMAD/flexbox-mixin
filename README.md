# Flexbox Mixin Project

### The goal of this exercise is for the given HTML prototype using a Flexbox layout, to wrap every Flexbox rule into a SASS mixin so that it can be called in every spot where a Flexbox declaration is required.

### The Flexbox rules/arguments required for the project are:

    display: flex
    justify-content
    flex
    flex-direction
    align-items
